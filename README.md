GeneralAvali is a new in-dev mod for Rimworld.

After the loss of Erisss' Avali mod I asked them for permission to use their wholy coded parts for implimentation into a new Avali mod. This is that mod. While I'm still tinkering away trying to learn to code at the same time as working on this it is technically open for anyone to contribute to.

General Avali's original vision was to be a modular experience of a mod. Allowing players to disable select parts they dislike. Seeing as I have no idea how to do that, the mod for the most part be a all-in-one package, but will hopefully late have the option for players to disable some of the more "ehhh" parts of the mod such as the Avali's planned weaponry and select research, and quirks of being an Avali.

Until you see the mod labled as version 0.5 the mod does not work and it is not worth your time to download it unless youre actively trying to get it to work.
